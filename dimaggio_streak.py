# From May 15th to July 16th 1941, Joe Dimaggio batted safely in an unprecidented 56 straight games,
# a record that still stands to this day. 
# The feat has been called "the most extraordinary thing that ever happened in American sports."
# This statistical achievement is believed to be unbreakable.
# 
# This is the formula to calculate the odds of such a streak:
#
# (1-(1-p)**(ab/n))**n
# where p = batting percentage, ab = at bats, and n = number of games.
