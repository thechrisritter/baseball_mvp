Creating a method to find the real MLB MVP

My goal is to create a metric for finding out how valuable a player is to each team. 
I want to create a program that allows a user to enter a players name, then the program will replace his stats with the league average for that postion and determine how that team's wins/loses will be affected. 
I have no idea how or even if this will work, it's just an experiment to challenge myself to learn python.
